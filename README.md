This study explores the intricate interplay of sexual selection, allometry, and intralocus sexual conflict in shaping the evolution of sexual dimorphism in Drosophila wing shape and size. Contradictory findings regarding the stability of sexual shape dimorphism in Drosophila prompt a closer examination of allometry's contribution to the evolution of wing shape dimorphism. The study delves into the complex relationship between intersexual genetic correlation, intralocus sexual conflict, and the constraints they impose on the evolution of sexual dimorphism. The evidence suggests that shared genetic architecture between males and females limits the evolutionary response of wing shape dimorphism, highlighting the role of intralocus sexual conflict. Furthermore, the study explores the potential resolution of such conflicts by evolving condition-dependent traits.
The concept of condition dependence is investigated in the context of Drosophila wing size and shape, revealing a link between nutrition, mating success, and the observed sexual dimorphism. The study extends its focus to interspecific patterns, exploring how the degree of sexual shape and size dimorphism correlates with condition dependence across a phylogeny of flies. The findings suggest that species with more pronounced sexual dimorphism exhibit stronger condition dependence for sexually selected traits.

The objective of this study will be to look at the cell counts in the wings of different Drsophila species and how sexually dimorphic the cell counts are in the species of Drosophila. The biological questions we would like to answer are as follows;

1) Condition dependence difference in the cell counts in the wings of different Drosophila species. 
2) Within the same species, how dimorphic is the condition dependent cell count in the wings.
